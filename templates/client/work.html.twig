      <h3>Process & Practice</h3>
      <p>
        My studio practice centers on exploration and experimentation. I begin each piece by establishing a dialogue between materials—letting paint, charcoal, and fabric speak to each other before I impose structure. This organic beginning allows unexpected relationships to emerge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process is both meditative and dynamic. Layers build slowly, with periods of intense activity followed by contemplative pauses. I believe the best work happens when technique serves vision, not the other way around.

      <h3>On Inspiration</h3>
      <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <p class="fst-italic">
          "New iron, machine-ruled life with the car growling, electric lights… woke up the soul which… came to the crossroads of the sky and earth ways. If all the artists would have seen the crossroads of sky and earth ways and understood… the binding of our bodies and the clouds in the sky – they wouldn't paint chrysanthemums."

      <p>
        This sentiment resonates deeply with my approach. We live in an age of constant transformation, and art must grapple with the tension between tradition and innovation, stillness and movement, the earth and the sky.

      <h3>Materials & Meaning</h3>
      <p>
        Each medium carries its own history and possibilities. Charcoal offers immediacy and rawness, paint brings color and depth, textiles add texture and tactile warmth. By combining these materials, I create works that engage multiple senses and invite prolonged contemplation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm particularly drawn to the challenge of making abstract work feel emotionally accessible. Geometry and color can communicate just as powerfully as representation when handled with intention and care.
