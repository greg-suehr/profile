      <p class="lead">
        Sasha Beal is a multimedia artist and designer based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, creating dynamic works that blend traditional and contemporary techniques.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Working primarily with paint, charcoal, and textiles, Sasha creates pieces that explore the intersection of geometric abstraction and organic form. Her work draws inspiration from the rich tradition of Eastern European modernism while maintaining a distinctly contemporary voice.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Sasha's artistic practice is informed by the bold compositional work of Ukrainian avant-garde artists, including the lyrical abstraction of Mykhailo Boychuk, the revolutionary geometric innovations of Kazymyr Malevych, and the expressive contemporary work of Ivan Marchuk. These influences merge with her own exploration of color, texture, and spatial relationships to create work that is both historically grounded and thoroughly modern.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Whether creating commissioned pieces, illustrating publications, or developing custom designs, Sasha brings meticulous attention to detail and a collaborative spirit to every project. She believes that art should be accessible, meaningful, and reflective of the unique vision of each client.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        When she's not in the studio, Sasha can be found exploring Pittsburgh's vibrant arts scene, experimenting with new materials and techniques, or planning her next creative collaboration.
