    <h1>Research</h1>    
    <div class="section">
      <p>
        During my time at the University of Pittsburgh, I had a mentor who liked to say: <i>"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be research."</i>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        It was a comforting thought (and likely repeated as often as it was for my own benefit).        
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Research is a difficult thing.
        My experience as an <i>undergraduate researcher</i> was very much like climbing a mountain.
        At first I moved slowly, but felt like a trailblazer. The world was foggy. Every crumb of knowledge I collected was exciting and new.
        But as I got further up the hill I realized more and more there was a well-worn trail extended miles ahead of me.
        Not only was I not a trailblazer, I was not even progressing along the trail as competently as many of my colleagues.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Around the same time, I experienced a crisis of faith regarding what I had seen as a <i>fundamental</i> character of physics research.
        As I learned more of the history of science, I saw <i>modernity</i> less as the edge of the future and more like the future past.
        My perspective of science shifted from that of a mountain we were climbing to a bowl we were filling.
        <i>Cutting-edge research</i> was still an interface to an open unknown, but to be a part of that rising flood required a sacrificial flattening,
        a wholesale dedication of an entire career to a very small piece of the puzzle.
        I was not a mountaineer so much as a drop of water, especially in the world of Big Science that commands high energy physics research.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This sense of the <i>flatness</i> of scientific research was a challenge to my ego.
        More critically, I developed a perspective that this bowl we were filling had a leak,
        along with an acute worry that nobody had a measure on what and how much knowledge a culture could lose.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The hole in human culture is responsible for two deleterious effects.
        First, it slows the progress of our filling the bowl by removing substantive knowledge through a natural process of attrition.
        The knowledge a culture pursues and retains is scoped by the material structure, activities, and values of that culture.
        Everything must be passed on, or it will be forgotten.
        As the values and needs of culture shift over time, our persistent forgetting creates potholes which inevitably researchers must turn back to and fill.
      <!--
        The idea of lost knowledge is often treated as a contigent historical fact or trivia.
        If knowledge is a mountain to climb, then any "lost knowledge" is a set back at worst, one we are only ever more capable of making up with each step.
        But, simply put, I find it difficult to maintain a confidence that the ultimate in light of our most current knowledge from the field of physics.
        -->
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        This is a more practical problem for researchers than the idea that it is worth knowing our history (which I also believe to be true).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        The second <i>deleterious effect</i> of the hole in human culture is that while these <i>potholes</i> remain unfilled,
        there is a not emptiness but a fragile structure which threatens the integrity of the knowledge piled above.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Our knowledge is not grounded on the researcher and their individual understanding.
        Simply put, we collectively know too much. Our knowledge leans back on itself,
        and it is nearly impossible to tell whether any particular fact we rely on is well founded without climbing the whole mountain over again.
        As a result, out of necessity, we employ facts we do not know.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        In pursuit of a career other than physics research, I leaned on my experience programming to build a very practical career in business software.
