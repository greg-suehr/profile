                    I am currently looking for a full-time role in software engineering.

                  <p>
                    I try to pick up new skills regularly, and generally think                    
                    good design, documentation, and processes determine software quality more than stack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    That said, most of my work has been in the following environments:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>PHP:</strong> Symfony, Doctrine, Twig.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Perl:</strong> nginx, DBIx, Template Toolkit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Python:</strong> uWSGI, Django, Flask, FastAPI.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    I have worked on a variety of systems, including:
                    (i) ERP and financial accounting software with complex business logic,
                    (ii) data pipelines in high performance computing projects,
                    (iii) crawlers and knowledge graphs.
                    And more! I'm always looking for new hallenges and interesting problems to solve.

                  <p>
                    Dealing with the data is my specialialty. I've acquired a particular set of skills including:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Schema design and query optimization in <strong>Postgres</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Building and debugging ETL pipelines.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Writing convulting queries to get you that report you need,
                      which I'll do if you buy me coffee.
                    </li>

                  <p>
                    Deploying code is almost as fun as debugging it. Don't you think?

                    As a matter of necessity, I've gotten myself into and out of trouble using:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Git:</strong> and I'll resolve your merge conflict if you buy me coffee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>AWS:</strong> cost analysis and configuration.
                    </li>                    
                    <li>
                      <strong>Docker:</strong> actually, I've never had trouble with Docker. Docker is amazing.
                    </li>

                  <p>
                    I have excellent taste.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even better, I know when to call on collaborators with even better taste or situated knowledge
                    to ensure projects I work on start with great design and end polished and highly functional.

                    I'm passionate about design systems and
                    creating consistent, scalable component libraries that improve both developer experience and user interface quality.

                    I don't have much experience in robotics (that's why it's sorted low on this list).
                    I do have a well used Arduino kit, and aspirations to build a robot drummer Ã  la

                    My first programming work was on the data analysis pipeline for
                    <a href="https://belle.kek.jp/">Belle</a> and <a href="https://www.belle2.org/">Belle II</a>
                    particle physics experiments.

                    I've leveraged my physics training and tools like
                    Three.js, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy
                    to build a host of useful tools and interesting simulations.
