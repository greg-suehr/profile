My approach to designing and deploying technology prioritizes the human-in-the-loop,
and a balance of beauty and function.

It is also language agnostic.

(i) Web applications
(ii) Business systems: ERP, CRM, integrations with eCommerce, logistics, and payments.
(iii) Data piplines for (iv) Web crawlers
