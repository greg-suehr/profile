<p>Let's build something uniquely yours.</p>
<div>
  <p>
    You deserve a website that's actually yours.
  </p>
  <p>
    I create custom websites that you own outright - designed around your needs, not a template's constraints.
    As a solo developer with 7+ years of engineering experience building complex software systems, I bring technical depth without agency overhead.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Direct communication with the person building your site
    </li>
    <li>
      Solutions tailored to your actual workflow and goals
    </li>
    <li>
      Clean, maintainable code you can take anywhere
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    I'm currently building my portfolio of web design clients, which means you get experienced engineering at accessible rates while I establish this side of my practice.

      Your website should work as hard as you do.
      I build custom sites from the ground up - whether that's a portfolio to showcase your work, an event site, or a business presence that reflects who you actually are.
      Modern, responsive design that looks great on any device.
      I handle the technical details so you don't have to.
      Reliable hosting, security updates, backups, and ongoing support to keep your site running smoothly.

      Have a specific business problem that off-the-shelf software doesn't quite solve?
      I specialize in building custom tools and integrations - from automation workflows to data management systems.
