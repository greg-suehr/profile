### Ownership (1-10)

5. **You Own Your Data**  
   Category: Ownership | Tags: Privacy, Control  
   *Your customer data, analytics, content - it's all yours, stored where you want it.*

10. **No Features Held Hostage**  
    Category: Ownership | Tags: Control, Flexibility  
    *Need a feature? We build it. Don't need one? We don't include it. No upselling to "premium" tiers.*

### UX Philosophy (11-20)

18. **Navigation Should Be Obvious**  
    Category: UX Philosophy | Tags: Usability, Fundamentals  
    *If users can't find what they need in three clicks, we've failed.*

### Technical (21-32)

24. **Database Design That Scales**  
    Category: Technical | Tags: Architecture, Growth  
    *Start small, but with a schema that won't collapse when you grow.*

26. **API-First Architecture**  
    Category: Technical | Tags: Integration, Flexibility  
    *Build your site with APIs from day one. Integrations become trivial.*

27. **Security By Design**  
    Category: Technical | Tags: Security, Best Practices  
    *HTTPS, input validation, SQL injection prevention - built in from the start.*

28. **Automated Testing Prevents Disasters**  
    Category: Technical | Tags: Quality, Confidence  
    *Catch bugs before they reach production. Sleep better at night.*

29. **Performance Budgets**  
    Category: Technical | Tags: Speed, Discipline  
    *Set hard limits on page weight and load time. Then enforce them.*

### Business (33-42)

33. **Transparent Pricing**  
    Category: Business | Tags: Honesty, Clarity  
    *Fixed bids or hourly. Never surprise invoices or hidden fees.*

35. **No Hostage Negotiations**  
    Category: Business | Tags: Ethics, Respect  
    *Want to move to another developer? Here's all your code and documentation. Good luck!*

### Process (43-50)

### Platform Critique (51-57)

6. **No Platform Tax**  
   Category: Ownership | Tags: Economics, Independence  
   *Build a $100K/year business without giving Shopify or Squarespace their cut.*

51. **WordPress Isn't Always the Answer**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Nuance, Right Tool  
    *Great for blogs. Overkill for static sites. Vulnerable if not maintained. Let's choose tools that fit.*

52. **Page Builders Make Bad Code**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Technical Debt, Performance  
    *Elementor and Divi generate bloated HTML that crushes performance.*

53. **Wix SEO Is Still Limited**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Marketing, Limitations  
    *Better than it was, but still can't match custom sites for SEO flexibility.*

54. **Squarespace's Template Trap**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Limitations, Design  
    *Beautiful templates until you need something custom. Then you're stuck.*

55. **Shopify Transaction Fees Add Up**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Economics, Hidden Costs  
    *2% of every sale if you don't use Shopify Payments. Forever.*

56. **Template Marketplaces Are Landfills**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Quality, Uniqueness  
    *Thousands of sites look identical. Poorly coded themes with bloated features.*

57. **Auto-Updates Break Things**  
    Category: Platform Critique | Tags: Control, Stability  
    *Platform updates shouldn't break your site. With custom code, we control when and how things change.*
